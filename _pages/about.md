I am a computational social scientist with a computer science background focused on the auditing sociotechnical
systems and in general information ecosystem. What we observe as uers experience on platforms is a complex interaction of society and technology. 
General features of my work on the study of digital technologies include carefully considering the whole spectrum from <strong>pure user
intention to pure platform design</strong>, <strong>performing cross-platform analysis</strong>, and <strong>putting observations into context</strong> when studying
complex systems. 
 



 

<h1>My Research</h1> 
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
 The overarching theme of my work is utilizing computational tools—machine learning, natural language processing, complex network analysis, and statistical and causal inference—to extract actionable and interpretable insights from data, typically with very little or no supervision. 
My work is inherently interdisciplinary and I collaborate closely with sociologists, economists, political scientists, and psychologists. 
Over the years, my research has been featured in the press and published in more than 30 peer-reviewed papers,
including computer science conferences and top journals such as PNAS, Science Advances, TKDE, and IMWUT.
