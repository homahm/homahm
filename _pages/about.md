I am a computational social scientist with a computer science background focused on the study of auding sociotechnical
systems and in general information ecosystem. Motivated by the high impact of these real-world issues in our daily lives, my research revolves around AI for Social Good, with a major focus on evaluating the scale and dynamics of problems of societal importance. The overarching theme of my work is
utilizing computational tools—machine learning, natural language processing, complex network analysis, and statistical and causal
inference—to extract actionable and interpretable insights from data, typically with very little or no supervision. 


<h1>My Research</h1> 
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
My work is
inherently interdisciplinary and I collaborate closely with sociologists, economists, political scientists, and psychologists. One of the
most puzzling questions about online platforms for me has been whether what we observe on platforms such as Instagram or YouTube
is more a result of the platform design, e.g., its algorithms, or a reflection of society through the lens of the platform. It is hard to
answer which, but it is easy to forget about the role of human behavior when it comes to technology’s disturbing consequences.


General features of my work on the study of digital technologies include carefully considering the whole spectrum from pure user
intention to pure platform design, performing cross-platform analysis, and putting observations into context when studying
complex systems. Over the years, my research has been featured in the press and published in more than 30 peer-reviewed papers,
including computer science conferences and top journals such as PNAS, Science Advances, TKDE, and IMWUT.
