One of the most puzzling questions about online platforms for me has been whether what we observe on platforms such as Instagram or YouTube
is more a result of the platform design, e.g., its algorithms, or a reflection of society through the lens of the platform. It is hard to
answer which, but it is easy to forget about the role of human behavior when it comes to technologyâ€™s disturbing consequences.
General features of my work on the study of digital technologies include carefully considering the whole spectrum from pure user
intention to pure platform design, performing cross-platform analysis, and putting observations into context when studying
complex systems.
